## üìä How It Works

### 1. Data Input
- **Bins**: Add trash bins with location coordinates, fill levels, and capacity
- **Trucks**: Configure collection vehicles with capacity and current load
- **Interactive Map**: Click to place bins or use the input forms

### 2. Route Optimization Process

#### Step 1: Graph Creation
- Creates a complete graph where bins are nodes
- Calculates distances using the Haversine formula
- Generates edges between all bin pairs

#### Step 2: Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal's Algorithm)
- Sorts edges by distance (weight)
- Uses Disjoint Set Union (DSU) for cycle detection
- Builds MST for efficient city-wide connectivity

#### Step 3: Cluster Formation (Adapted Kadane's Algorithm)
- Groups bins based on density and fill levels
- Prioritizes high-fill bins (>80% capacity)
- Uses BFS for connected component identification

#### Step 4: Route Optimization (Dynamic Programming)
- Solves TSP for each cluster using DP with bitmasks
- Finds optimal visit sequences within clusters
- Minimizes total travel distance

#### Step 5: Truck Assignment
- Assigns optimized routes to available trucks
- Considers capacity constraints and current loads
- Prioritizes high-priority bins across all routes

### 3. Real-time Features
- **Live Simulation**: Automatic fill level updates
- **Route Recalculation**: Dynamic optimization as conditions change
- **Predictive Modeling**: 24-hour fill level forecasting
- **Performance Metrics**: Distance, waste collected, efficiency tracking

## üéØ Key Algorithms Explained

### Kruskal's Algorithm
```typescript
// Finds Minimum Spanning Tree for city-wide optimization
export function runKruskalsAlgorithm(graph: Graph): Edge[]
```
- **Purpose**: Creates efficient road network representation
- **Complexity**: O(E log E) where E is number of edges
- **Benefit**: Reduces redundant connections between bins

### Dynamic Programming (TSP)
```typescript
// Optimizes bin visit sequence within clusters
export function optimizeRouteWithDP(cluster: Cluster, graph: Graph): number[]
```
- **Purpose**: Solves Traveling Salesman Problem for small clusters
- **Complexity**: O(n¬≤ √ó 2‚Åø) where n is cluster size
- **Benefit**: Guarantees optimal sequence for cluster traversal

### B+ Tree Implementation
```typescript
// Efficient data storage and retrieval
export class BPlusTree
```
- **Purpose**: Fast bin data access and range queries
- **Complexity**: O(log n) for search, insert, delete
- **Benefit**: Scales efficiently with large numbers of bins
